  <p align="right">- Lloyd Doggett, Congressman, D-Texas </p>
  <p>" ...Dr. Zhu is a highly regarded visiting professor teaching traditional Chinese medicine and herbology in Austin, Texas.

  <p align="right">- Joseph Juliano, M.D. </p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="returntotop" href="#top">Return to top</span></a>  <p><strong><a href="acupuncture.htm">ACUPUNCTURE </a></strong></p>
  <p>The World Health Organization cites 104 different conditions that acupuncture can successfully treat. Thin needles are inserted subcutaneously into exact three-dimensional locatation called acupuncture points, which function as reservoirs of life force or qi. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="traditional.htm">TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE</a></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Chinese medicine originated 5,000 year ago from experimentation with medicinal substances from animal, plant, and mineral sources and acupuncture points. Empirical evidence collected from these experiments combined with Daoist and Confucian philosophy produced the body of knowledge that today we call Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="integratedmedicine.htm">INTEGRATED MEDICINE </a></strong></p>
  <p>The integration of conventional and Chinese medicine forms a new comprehensive type of medical care. The diagnostic tools made available by conventional medicine, such as MRI, CT scans, needle biopsy, and laboratory assay combined with the diagnostic tools used in traditional Chinese medicine, such as pulse and tongue diagnosis, a thorough history, and physical examination makes it possible to effectively treat the whole person. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><a href="hepatitis.htm">HEPATITIS &nbsp; C</a> </strong></p>
  <p>Information provided by lab test results combined with a Chinese medical diagnosis gives hope to many suffering from hepatitis C. Experimental and clinical observations show that certain Chinese herbal prescriptions boost the immune system, produce anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects on the liver in addition to reducing jaundice, heal damaged liver cells, and preventing cirrhosis. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>WOMEN'S  HEALTH  ISSUES </strong></p>
  <p>Traditional Chinese medicine recognizes womens' health issues as pattern-related syndromes. By treating the entire disorder, women using traditional Chinese medicine typically experience a dramatic reduction in all their symptoms whether they deal with menopause, infertility, PMS, endometriosis, or ovarian cysts. </p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="returntotop" href="#top">Return to top</span></a>  <p><strong><a href="fertility.htm">INFERTILITY</a> </strong></p>
  <p>Chinese medicine prepares the body for conception by bringing it back in to balance. This is a key concept in traditional Chinese medicine, balancing the yin and yang of the body. The basis for treatment always starts with a diagnosis according to Chinese medical philosophy, whose foundation lies in identifying constitutional imbalances, presenting symptoms, and determining the proper way to address the imbalance. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><a href="menopause.htm">MENOPAUSE </a></strong></p>
  <p>In China, most menopausal women use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), particularly Chinese herbs, instead of hormone therapy. A history of long-time use and thorough documentation make it the treatment of choice for Chinese women. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="smoking.htm">QUIT SMOKING</a> </strong></p>
  <p>Chinese medicine helps to reduce smokers' cravings by using acupuncture, auricular (ear) acupuncture, and herbal medicine. Using acupuncture and the correct Chinese herbal formula will promote the smooth flow of qi, or vital energy, in the Liver, balance the digestive tract's absorptive function (governed by the Spleen organ system), regulate Lung qi, calm the mind, increase energy levels, and reduce symptoms from quit smoking syndrome. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="backpain.htm">PAIN MANAGEMENT</a> </strong></p>
  <p>There is an ancient Chinese saying that aptly describes the origin of pain: "Where you find stagnation, you will find pain." Stagnation, or obstruction, in a certain meridian or muscular region can cause pain. By inserting a needle, using certain herbs, and massage traditional Chinese medicine can help relieve any kind of pain, whether it's a headache, back pain , or neck and shoulder pain. </p>
  <p><a href="depression.htm"><strong>DEPRESSION</strong></a> </p>
  <p>In Chinese medicine, the liver governs emotions such as anger, frustration, depression, sadness, and mood swings. The liver functions not only as an important filtration and blood-cleansing organ, but also as a major conduit for qi, or vital energy. If the liver cannot maintain a smooth flow of qi, situational and endogenous depression may occur. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>STROKE &nbsp; REHABILITATION </strong></p>
  <p>In China, hospitals integrate conventional and traditional medicine to treat stroke patients. Emergency room care is identical to that found here in the United States, but once leaving the ER, treatment is quite different. In addition to intravenous drips of Chinese herbs, scalp acupuncture makes up an important part each patient's treatment . </p>
  <p><strong>WEIGHT MANAGEMENT </strong></p>
  <p>Our weight loss process consists of five sessions. Certain points on the outer ear form a reflex system that affects internal organs when properly stimulated. We use ear acupuncture on stomach and endocrine points, which balance digestive and absorptive functions. In addition, raises the metabolic rate, while increasing energy and eliminating excess fluid. Chinese herbs are an important part of the treatment. </p>
