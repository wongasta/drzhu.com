  <br><p>"Dr. Zhu has established himself as a distinguished visiting professor who is providing his skills in traditional Chinese medicine to complement western medicine in the treatment of patients...Dr Zhu adds a body of knowledge and experience supported by his research and clinical applications that is unique. I have received several letters from physicians and community leaders in this community supporting the research and adjunctive therapy Dr. Zhu is providing to patients who might otherwise not respond to traditional Western medicine alone." </p>
  <p align="right">- Lloyd Doggett, Congressman, D-Texas </p>
  <p>" ...Dr. Zhu is a highly regarded visiting professor teaching traditional Chinese medicine and herbology in Austin, Texas. Dr. Zhu has worked with my office, using Chinese herbal formulas in the care of patients...and has eagerly assisted us with knowledge gained from these studies.

  <p align="right">- Donald R. Counts, M.D. </p>
  <p>"...I am impressed with Dr. Zhu's credentials and dedication in achieving his numerous degree[s]...[making him] one of a very few individuals in the US and the world to hold such a title in his field and due to the specialized research performed to attain such."</p>
  <p>- &nbsp; Joseph Juliano, M.D. </p>

  <p>"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the medical attention you have given us in the last months, and to ask you kindly if you would like to share your knowledge and experience in acupuncture and Chinese medicine with our Mexican community here in Austin." </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Lt. Col. Brian C. Harrington, Medical Corps Director, U.S. Army &nbsp; </p>
  <p>"I want to thank you for using acupuncture to treat Dr. George Kozmentsky for ALS [ Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis] for nearly two years. Although ALS is a terminal disease, the alleviation of pain, the &nbsp; physical and psychological comfort you provided for Dr. Kozmentsky through acupuncture were of great service to him. Your invaluable counseling and expert advice were extremely helpul to him in maintaining good spirits and intellectual spark. Every time after his treatment sessions he felt more relaxed and more energized to face another day. </p>
  <p>"You know for a fact that Dr. Kozmetsky respected you very much and had a special consideration for you. Again, thank you very much. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dr. Abdu Megateli, long time collaborator and close friend of Dr. George Kozmetsky </p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="returntotop" href="#top">Return to top</span></a>  <p><strong><a href="acupuncture.htm">ACUPUNCTURE </a></strong></p>
  <p>The World Health Organization cites 104 different conditions that acupuncture can successfully treat. Thin needles are inserted subcutaneously into exact three-dimensional locatation called acupuncture points, which function as reservoirs of life force or qi. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="traditional.htm">TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE</a></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Chinese medicine originated 5,000 year ago from experimentation with medicinal substances from animal, plant, and mineral sources and acupuncture points. Empirical evidence collected from these experiments combined with Daoist and Confucian philosophy produced the body of knowledge that today we call Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="integratedmedicine.htm">INTEGRATED MEDICINE </a></strong></p>
  <p>The integration of conventional and Chinese medicine forms a new comprehensive type of medical care. The diagnostic tools made available by conventional medicine, such as MRI, CT scans, needle biopsy, and laboratory assay combined with the diagnostic tools used in traditional Chinese medicine, such as pulse and tongue diagnosis, a thorough history, and physical examination makes it possible to effectively treat the whole person. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><a href="hepatitis.htm">HEPATITIS &nbsp; C</a> </strong></p>
  <p>Information provided by lab test results combined with a Chinese medical diagnosis gives hope to many suffering from hepatitis C. Experimental and clinical observations show that certain Chinese herbal prescriptions boost the immune system, produce anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects on the liver in addition to reducing jaundice, heal damaged liver cells, and preventing cirrhosis. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>WOMEN'S  HEALTH  ISSUES </strong></p>
  <p>Traditional Chinese medicine recognizes womens' health issues as pattern-related syndromes. By treating the entire disorder, women using traditional Chinese medicine typically experience a dramatic reduction in all their symptoms whether they deal with menopause, infertility, PMS, endometriosis, or ovarian cysts. </p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><span class="returntotop" href="#top">Return to top</span></a>  <p><strong><a href="fertility.htm">INFERTILITY</a> </strong></p>
  <p>Chinese medicine prepares the body for conception by bringing it back in to balance. This is a key concept in traditional Chinese medicine, balancing the yin and yang of the body. The basis for treatment always starts with a diagnosis according to Chinese medical philosophy, whose foundation lies in identifying constitutional imbalances, presenting symptoms, and determining the proper way to address the imbalance. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><a href="menopause.htm">MENOPAUSE </a></strong></p>
  <p>In China, most menopausal women use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), particularly Chinese herbs, instead of hormone therapy. A history of long-time use and thorough documentation make it the treatment of choice for Chinese women. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="smoking.htm">QUIT SMOKING</a> </strong></p>
  <p>Chinese medicine helps to reduce smokers' cravings by using acupuncture, auricular (ear) acupuncture, and herbal medicine. Using acupuncture and the correct Chinese herbal formula will promote the smooth flow of qi, or vital energy, in the Liver, balance the digestive tract's absorptive function (governed by the Spleen organ system), regulate Lung qi, calm the mind, increase energy levels, and reduce symptoms from quit smoking syndrome. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="backpain.htm">PAIN MANAGEMENT</a> </strong></p>
  <p>There is an ancient Chinese saying that aptly describes the origin of pain: "Where you find stagnation, you will find pain." Stagnation, or obstruction, in a certain meridian or muscular region can cause pain. By inserting a needle, using certain herbs, and massage traditional Chinese medicine can help relieve any kind of pain, whether it's a headache, back pain , or neck and shoulder pain. </p>
  <p><a href="depression.htm"><strong>DEPRESSION</strong></a> </p>
  <p>In Chinese medicine, the liver governs emotions such as anger, frustration, depression, sadness, and mood swings. The liver functions not only as an important filtration and blood-cleansing organ, but also as a major conduit for qi, or vital energy. If the liver cannot maintain a smooth flow of qi, situational and endogenous depression may occur. &nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>STROKE &nbsp; REHABILITATION </strong></p>
  <p>In China, hospitals integrate conventional and traditional medicine to treat stroke patients. Emergency room care is identical to that found here in the United States, but once leaving the ER, treatment is quite different. In addition to intravenous drips of Chinese herbs, scalp acupuncture makes up an important part each patient's treatment . </p>
  <p><strong>WEIGHT MANAGEMENT </strong></p>
  <p>Our weight loss process consists of five sessions. Certain points on the outer ear form a reflex system that affects internal organs when properly stimulated. We use ear acupuncture on stomach and endocrine points, which balance digestive and absorptive functions. In addition, raises the metabolic rate, while increasing energy and eliminating excess fluid. Chinese herbs are an important part of the treatment. </p>
