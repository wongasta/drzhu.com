    “Dear Dr. Zhu: </p>
    <p>I am writing thank you for excellent care. Your skill and knowledge of medicine including the use and benefits of acupuncture have helped me tremendously. I had a large herniated disk in my neck (C-6 and C-7), which caused me chronic pain and gave me muscle spasms in my shoulders. Your acupuncture treatments have been of great benefit to me, as has your continued counseling including using traction, resting my neck, and being careful in my activities. I was delighted when I received the results of my most recent MRI and was informed that the herniation of my disk had decreased significantly in size. My neurologist also noted that I have good mobility in my neck. I attribute much of the credit for the progress in the improvement of my neck to your continued care. I am delighted that you have helped to provide me with a surgical alternative. I very much appreciate having less pain. </p>
    <p>I feel truly blessed and lucky. Thank you very much.”<br>

    <p>“Dear Dr. Zhu:</p>
    <p>Great News! I had an updated MRI performed and my cervical herniated disk is gone. Enclosed is the radiology report of 9/27/2000 for your records. <br>
      Thank you for your excellent and kind care and friendship. <br>

    <p>“Dear Dr. Zhu,</p>
    <p>I am writing to thank you for saving my life. Four years ago my doctors told me I was dying due to complications related to hepatitis C. A liver biopsy in 1996 showed mild activity compatible with hepatitis C, no cirrhosis, and mild scarring. In 1998, lab tests consistently showed elevated liver enzymes, so I began a course of interferon and riboviran, but the side effects were too difficult to tolerate. I felt very fatigued, had nausea, felt constant pain in the area around my liver, and had heavy sweating. Having exhausted the resources available by conventional medicine, my primary care doctor suggested I see you for Chinese herbal medicine treatment. After six months of herbal treatment, my liver enzyme levels went back to normal and all of my symptoms disappeared. </p>
    <p>Your skill and knowledge of Chinese herbs helped me return to an active and productive life. I can continue to do the work I love as a record producer and musician here in Austin. </p>
    <p>I continue to see my primary care physician and to undergo routine blood tests. My liver enzymes have tested in the normal range for two years and my quality of life is greatly improved. </p>
    <p>I have regained my health and feel great. I will continue to take the herbal formulas you prescribe and to recommend your care to my friends who suffer from Hepatitis C.</p>
    <p>Thank you for giving me my life back.</p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br>
      ------- Tarry Owens, musician</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Zhu,</p>
    <p>On this most opportune day, I wish to express to you professor Zhu my utmost respect for your kindness, expertise and healing effects. Since I begin seeing you in early 2000, I have been struggling with bi polar disorder, anxiety and jaw clenching pain. Your understanding and tolerance have allow me to pursue psychiatric medical and therapy treatment that play an important role in my healthcare.</p>
    <p>Althou not completely freed of the above condition, thanks to your supervision and care, I am in a much healther state that I ever dreamed possible. I am able to pursue my every day life with greater calm and resolve, continue my academic career and grow a new family life as an expecting mother.</p>
    <p>I want to express my gratitude for your skilld hands and knowledge of acupressure and acupuncture. I am especially appreciative of your unique skills in scalp acupuncture that I have found to be extremely beneficial for alleviating stress, anxiety and my depressive episodes.</p>
    <p>May our relationship continue into the future and your practice flourish. With my sincere gratitude,</p>

    <p>September 8, 2003</p>
    <p>Dear Dr. Zhu,</p>
    <p>I would like to thank you for the tremendous improvement in my range of<br>
      motion as a result of acupuncture and acupressure treatment.  After 18<br>
      months of worsening lower back pain following an injury, I was confined to<br>
      bed about six hours a day when I first visited you.  I was facing epidural<br>
      injections of steroids, which seemed to be the only solution for what had<br>
      been diagnosed as a herniated disc.  I don't think it ever occurred to the<br>
      neurosurgeon I was seeing that the condition might be due to a muscle spasm.<br>
      I'm so thankful I visited you before I had the steroid treatment, which<br>
      assuredly would not have helped my condition.  In only two weeks I was able<br>
      to resume life in a vertical position. After three months, I'm moving<br>
      normally and exercising.  Imagine what we could have accomplished if I had<br>
      come to you immediately after the injury, instead of living with it for a<br>
      year-and-a-half!</p>
    <p>In deep appreciation,</p>
    <p> ---------- Deirdre Mendez, PhD</p>

    <p>“Dear Dr. Zhu,</p>
    <p>To say that I am grateful for your help is such a feeble expression.<br>
      Every winter and since I was teenager, I suffered from spasm in the lower back and pain in the left leg, which made moving a painful experience.</p>
    <p>Conventional medicine helped a little at times, but the healing was always temporary, let along the side effects of medication. Acupuncture has proven very effective, healing, and long lasting. Thanks to you magic hands and well-mastered art, I feel great.<br>
      May you be always guided and may life’s blessings surround your life at all time.” </p>

    <p>“Dr. Zhu,</p>
    <p>I want to thank you for the wonderful care, kindness and understanding on treating me for my premenopausal symptoms. </p>
    <p>For several years prior to my treatment with Chinese medicine, I had been suffering gradual and then severe premenopausal symptoms. My family physician prescribed birth control pills to alleviate my severe headaches, lengthy, painful, and unpredictable menstrual cycles, memory loss, weight gain, dryness, and alternating cold and hot flashes. My physician and his nurses insisted that it was normal for a woman my age (40) to begin getting these symptoms.</p>
    <p>I opted to seek an alternative means of treatment. I had not considered acupuncture as a first choice, but after several years of pure misery, I felt I needed to do something. Your assurance that the treatment would not hurt convinced me to proceed.</p>
    <p>After my first acupuncture treatment I felt instant relief. After several more treatments, which included taking Chinese herbs, my sense of balance, quality of life and mental health have been restored fully.</p>
    <p>I am at peace with my self. I recently went to my physician for my annual exam and an “over 40” physical. I received an excellent bill of health. I no longer suffer from any of the premeonpausal symptoms.</p>
    <p>Dr. Zhu, you were also able to cure the heel spur I suffered from for a year. I’m able to run five miles again.</p>
    <p>Through acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine I have learned to relax and I have made some changes in my life - to slow down and enjoy life. I have started taking tai chi lessons. My friends have noticed a change in me. My skin is more vibrant and the blemishes I had begin to disappear. Many of my friend now seek you for medical treatment.”</p>
    <p>Sincerely grateful,</p>

    <p>”Dearest Dr. Bindi Zhu, </p>
    <p>You really saved my face when I was stricken with Bell's Palsy.  Your expertise, perseverance and special generosity helped me go through this horribly painful condition.  Conventional medicine didn't have any healing effects or serious approach for treatment. </p>
    <p>Your skilled use of acupuncture, massage and herbs was crucial in my complete recovery from Bell’s Palsy.  I want to express my gratitude for your contributing to my restoration of self and ability to show my face in public with dignity.  I am forever indebted to you for nothing short of a miracle.  </p>
    <p>I wish you all the success and most of all, the recognition you deserve for your unique talents.</p>
    <p>Affectionately,<br>

    <p>After exhausting the resources of various specialists, including neurologists, allergists and ENT’s, one of my doctors referred me to Dr. Zhu for pain management. I had been suffering from cluster and complicated migraines and had tried a myriad of drug therapies unsuccessfully. The side effects, along with the migraine symptoms themselves, would be present for days at a time. I have been under the care of Dr. Zhu since May of 2001 and no longer take prescription drugs. The symptoms of cluster and complicated migraines are gone. I continue to visit Dr. Zhu for menstrual cramps and general wellness. The combined treatment of herbs and acupuncture has greatly improved my health. I offer my many thanks to Dr. Zhu for his specialized gifts, training and experience in traditional Chinese medicine; and a special thank you for his continued patience as I have learned to embrace the process of acupuncture.</p>

    <p>“ SEQ CHAPTER h r 1Dr. Zhu made a great change in my life. I thought I would have knee pain for the rest of my life. At times I could only walk a few steps and thought I might need a wheelchair in the future. A co-worker recommended Dr. Zhu. She explained the acupuncture process and I was willing to try an alternative to the medications I was taking to relieve the pain. On my first visit I was able to obtain relief from the pain. I did not need the 12 plus capsules of Advil I was taking. After a few bi-weekly sessions, I was able to walk without constant pain in my knee. After three months of treatment I was able to take daily walks and was able to hike 4 miles this summer during vacation without knee pain. I thank Dr. Zhu for his medical healing knowledge. I originally was skeptical that acupuncture and herbal medicine would completely relieve my pain but Dr. Zhu’s successful treatment turned me into a true believer. <br>

    <p>“When I came to Dr. Zhu’s office I was experiencing the symptoms of menopause: sweating, hot flashes, insomnia, and feeling emotional. I had resolved not to use hormones after reading some disturbing articles about their serious effects on women. Instead, I wanted to use something natural and decided to try Chinese medicine on the recommendation of a friend. After one month of acupuncture and taking herbs custom-made by Dr. Zhu, I felt great. All of my symptoms were gone. Thanks, Dr. Zhu!” <br>

    <p>“I had a car accident two years ago which gave me whiplash. I had a lot of pain in my neck. I tried everything I could to help the pain, even pain killers and other therapies. My husband had gone to Dr. Zhu for lower back pain six months after I had my accident and encouraged me to go see him over and over, but I was scared of the needles. Finally, after trying everything I could for another year and a half, I went to see Dr. Zhu. His warm and caring manner helped me to relax. He gave me a thorough explaination of how acupunture works and the needles didn’t even hurt! After three months my pain was gone.” </p>

    <p>“I have been diagnosised chronic fatigue syndrom for two years. I came to see Dr. Zhu on the recommendation of my physician. He said Dr. Zhu has success working with people who suffer from Chronic fatigue syndrom. Although I was very skeptical about going to an acupuncturist, I wanted all the help I could get! Now I felt pretty good most of the time. But I know that with this, and probably any other disease, you need to do everything you can to stay healthy. After my consultation with Dr. Zhu, he gave me some herbs that I take every day. I stay busy with my work, take my herbs, eat and exercise right and I have never felt so good in my entire life.” </p>
    <p>-------- Shen Kun, student </p>
    <p>&#8727; &#8727; &#8727; &#8727; &#8727; &#8727; &#8727; </p>
    <p>“Dr. Zhu changed my life. Before I came to see him, my physician wanted to operate on both of my knees for arthritis. I had taken many rounds of antibiotics and pain pills. I felt very ill. A friend referred me to Dr. Zhu. She told me a wonderful story about Dr. Zhu and how he helped her with low back pain. After two weeks, his healing hands took away my pain. I don’t take pain pills anymore, only acupuncture. I’ve had a total change of life. My husband also sees Dr. Zhu. At first he was scared of the needles, but now, he can’t live without them!” </p>
